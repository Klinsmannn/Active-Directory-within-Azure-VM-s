In Azure Cloud create your resource group with a Windows Server on it. Were going to set your Domain controllers ip to static(nonmoving) so that it can be discovered on the network.We go to out Networking tab in the Domain controller and select the NIC(Network Interface Card). Lastly enable ICMPv4 traffic in the Advance Firewall setting in your domain controller. You can find Firewall settings by typing it in the windows search bar or in Control panel> Systems and Security> Windows Defender Firewall.

Look up Server manager in your Domain controller and go into add Roles and Features. Next is to create your Forest and Root name for your Active Directory. Forest is like your main container containing other users,groups, and computers. Restart and Log back into Domain Controller.
